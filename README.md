# Project Start
## How to use
### Start

You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer.

You also need to have a `.env` file in the root folder of the project with the following lines:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=The user you want to use to connect to the database like 'postgres'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=The password you want to use to connect to the database like '123'
POSTGRES_DB=Name of the database you want to use like 'nest'
SERVER_IP=Ip of the server like 'http://localhost'
SERVER_PORT=Port of the server like '8080'
WEB_IP=Ip of the web app like 'http://localhost'
WEB_PORT=Port of the web app like '8081'
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=Your GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=Your GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Your GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=Your GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=Your DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=Your DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET
DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI=Your redirect url from the Redirects in the applications of Discord like 'services/discord/callback'
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=Your DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL=Email of the pgadmin user like 'admin@admin.com'
PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=Password of the pgadmin user like '123'
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=Your SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=Your SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

You can start the project with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose[.dev|.prod].yml up [-d] [--build]
# -f to specify the file to use, you can use docker-compose.dev.yml to use the dev version, it will enable the hot reload. (it will use Dockerfile.dev instead of Dockerfile)
# -d to run it in background
# --build to rebuild the images rather that running build each time
```
(you can remove -d to see the logs)

It will start each part of the projects in this order:
- The database
- The backend
- The setup of the database using a backend image
- The mobile app
- The web app

### Stop

You can stop the project with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose[.dev|.prod].yml down [--volumes] [--remove-orphans] [--rmi local]
# --volumes to remove the volumes
# --remove-orphans to remove the containers that are not in the docker-compose.yml file
# --rmi local to remove all the images, you can also use 'all' to remove all the images
```

### Update images

You can update the images of the project with the following command:
(don't forget to stop the project before [Stop](#stop))

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose[.dev|.prod].yml build
```

### Clean images

You can clean the images of the project with the following command:

```bash
docker image prune
```

It will remove all the images that are not used by a container like `<None>` images generated by the build command.
### PgAdmin

You can access the pgadmin interface at the following url: http://localhost:8083
You must connect with the email and password you set in the `.env` file.
After that you can add a new server with the following informations:
- Name: `It can be anything`
- Host name/address: `db`
- Port: `5432`
- Username: `It should be defined in the .env file as POSTGRES_USER`
- Password: `It should be defined in the .env file as POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

## Deployement

### Setup

You need to have [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) installed on your computer.
You also need to have a Compute instance on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](cloud.oracle.com) with VM.Standard3.Flex (Intel) shape with Oracle Linux 8.9 as operating system (We currently use 2 OCPU with 10GB of memory and it works very well). You also need to have a public IP address on this instance. (You can use the free tier to have a public IP address). You also need to register your ssh public key on the instance.

You need to create a `inventory` file like `inventory.example` file with corresponding informations:

```ini
[area]
YOUR_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS ansible_user=YOUR_USERNAME
```

After that, you just need to run the following command:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

It will clone the project on the remote server, copy local `.env` and install docker and docker-compose.

After that you need to connect to the remote server, move to Area folder and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

It will start each part of the projects.

/!\ Don't forget that it will copy local `.env` file, so you need to have the `.env` file with the correct informations on your computer /!\
